The content of this website is open for updates by users.

Especially the [DefinitelyTyped guides](/guides.html) and the [TypeScript directory](/directory.html) need your contributions.

If you have feedback or an idea for new pages then please let us know in the [issues](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/definitelytyped.github.io/issues).

## Editing content

If you only want to add some links to the [TypeScript directory](/directory.html) then you can edit the markdown using the github website interface and send a pull request from your browser. For more involved contributions you can fork the repos and work in a checkout before you send the pull request.

The repository with the site content is located at [github.com/DefinitelyTyped/definitelytyped.github.io](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/definitelytyped.github.io)

This site is generated using [docpad](http://docpad.org), a static site generator complete with watch tasks and a LiveReload development server.

The automated build runs [Grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com) on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/definitelytyped.github.io/actions).

See the [readme](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/definitelytyped.github.io/blob/source/README.md) for more detailed information and feel free to post a [ticket](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/definitelytyped.github.io/issues) if you have any questions.
